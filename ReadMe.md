# Programming test solutions

## Project description

### Introduction

This project contains my solutions for popular coding practice websites such as Leetcode, Hackerrank, "牛客网", the problem sets of it covering most interviewed questions in top ranking software companies, such as HSBC, HUAWEI.
The websites used as the source of coding problems are given below:

- [Leetcode cn](https://leetcode.cn)
- [Leetcode us](https://leetcode.com)
- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
- [牛客网](https://m.nowcoder.com)

### The problem sets of this project include:

- [尊享面试 100 题 top 100 interview questions for plus member](https://leetcode.cn/studyplan/premium-algo-100/)
- real questions asked in HSBC
- [华为机试题库 Huawei online coding test problem set](https://www.nowcoder.com/company/home?companyId=12598&order=1)

## Project structure

In the `src` directory, you can see the list of packages available, while the content are given by the package names. Inside the package folder, you can see the list of problem titles in the format of class files, and the solutions are given in the code.

In each class file, the link to the problem description and the test cases are given in the main method, and the solution is given in the method named by the class name.

You can also use the class name to search in `https://leetcode.cn`.

## How to use

For each java class, run it as a java application and the outputs for the provided test cases will show in the console.

## Disclaimer

The solutions are mostly based on my understanding of the programming tests and my experience, so they may not be the best solutions for the problems, or not the latest, conventional solutions, so using them as studying materials may not teach you the right algorithm or data structure to apply to the problem, but it is guaranteed that the solutions can pass the test review, as they are all successfully submitted.
